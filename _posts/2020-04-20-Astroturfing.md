title:  "Astroturfing during COVID-19 Reading List"
---
This was a reading list that I put together for my Digital Citizenship course during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

# Today's topic is Atroturfing.
> noun. US: The disguising of an orchestrated campaign as a "grass-roots" event â€“ i.e., a spontaneous upwelling of public opinion.

Why is that today's topic? We're seeing a huge astroturf campaign happening right now in anti-quarantine protests across the U.S. 

First, an introduction, from none other than John Oliver himself.

Now let's see what's going on now, from ...buzzfeed news? _ok..._

The Guardian stands a little taller with their conclusions:

This is _slightly_ off the topic, but here's a list of other issues concerning the Internet and COVID-19:

# Transmission of the Virus, a Review
I shouldn't have to say that these protests, however they are motivated, are ill-informed. The data is showing that coronavirus cases are still rising exponentially in most states. Here's a chart you can modify based on latest data:

[covid19chart.org (preconfigured for right-now)](https://covid19chart.org/#/?start=3%2F15%2F20&select=NJ%3BMI%3BLA%3BMA%3BIL%3BCT%3BCA%3BPA%3BFL%3BGA%3BRI&include=NY%3BNJ%3BMI%3BLA%3BMA%3BIL%3BCT%3BCA%3BPA%3BFL%3BGA%3BRI&top=0&norm=pop&stat=7day&series=deaths&scale=linear)

The rate of exponential increase is decreasing. It's no longer doubling every day, but it's still growing every day. It has not peaked, we don't know when it will, but we ARE slowing it down. To quote the author of that site, "All our painful social distancing has put the catastrophe into slow motion. But it has not solved the problem yet."

If you need a refresher, we know that the virus spreads from droplets people emit: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html)

And we know that people who show no symptoms can be a carrier (just like any flu-like virus, something we've all accepted since we here 5 years old but suddenly it isn't true now that we're being told  to stay inside for  the good of humanity*)

_*Mark's opinion, interjected into sentence of objective fact_

This article is from a week ago, but is still largely the state-of-the-science:

# My Investigation
The websites and facebook groups behind these groups appeared seemingly overnight. That's suspicious. That's not the pattern of how "normal people" get together to make grassroots movements. The domain names for "reopen[State]" were all registered on the same day. 

I did some investigation on my own. I ran a little test where I looked for the domain registration for each reopen[STATE].com  using all 50 state abbreviations. The registration of every domain is public record and easily found, You can do similar inquiries by going to [www.godaddy.com/whois](https://www.godaddy.com/whois). 

The registrant information is obfuscated in almost all of them, but what's shocking is that all 50 states exist, and with the exception of a two outliers, all of then were created between April 4 and April 17, with a suspicious 32 of them all created on April 17. This appears to support the hypothesis of there being organized, national influence behind these individual movements. (This post was written on April 20.) My raw data is below. 

# What I want you to write about
So what's going on? Is astroturfing happening, to what degree? The people who show up at these things must still have motivation to do so- what do you hypothesize that motivation could be? Have you seen people act in harmful ways (to themselves or to others)? How much do you trust the sources that I linked? Did you look a level deeper at where they got their information from? 

I want you to go find one other source to bring in for this discussion. Ideally one from a different outlet that has a different perspective or different angle on the situation. You can even refer to historical astroturfing campaigns, or specific things that have happened in your area. Just work it in to create a consistent narrative in your takeaway.
